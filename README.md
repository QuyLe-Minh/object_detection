# object_detection
Here is my submission of GDSC AI challenge competition from Kaggle. 

It is also considered as my small computer vision project. It detects objects from cifar-10 dataset (airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck) with accuracy > 90% using pretrained model Inception ResNetV2.
